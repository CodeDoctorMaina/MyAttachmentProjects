    """
    Options for rounding temporal values.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        multiple : int, default 1
            Number of units to round to.
        unit : str, default "day"
            The unit in which `multiple` is expressed.
            Accepted values are "year", "quarter", "month", "week", "day",
            "hour", "minute", "second", "millisecond", "microsecond",
            "nanosecond".
        week_starts_monday : bool, default True
            If True, weeks start on Monday; if False, on Sunday.
        ceil_is_strictly_greater : bool, default False
            If True, ceil returns a rounded value that is strictly greater than the
            input. For example: ceiling 1970-01-01T00:00:00 to 3 hours would
            yield 1970-01-01T03:00:00 if set to True and 1970-01-01T00:00:00
            if set to False.
            This applies to the ceil_temporal function only.
        calendar_based_origin : bool, default False
            By default, the origin is 1970-01-01T00:00:00. By setting this to True,
            rounding origin will be beginning of one less precise calendar unit.
            E.g.: rounding to hours will use beginning of day as origin.
    
            By default time is rounded to a multiple of units since
            1970-01-01T00:00:00. By setting calendar_based_origin to true,
            time will be rounded to number of units since the last greater
            calendar unit.
            For example: rounding to multiple of days since the beginning of the
            month or to hours since the beginning of the day.
            Exceptions: week and quarter are not used as greater units,
            therefore days will be rounded to the beginning of the month not
            week. Greater unit of week is a year.
            Note that ceiling and rounding might change sorting order of an array
            near greater unit change. For example rounding YYYY-mm-dd 23:00:00 to
            5 hours will ceil and round to YYYY-mm-dd+1 01:00:00 and floor to
            YYYY-mm-dd 20:00:00. On the other hand YYYY-mm-dd+1 00:00:00 will
            ceil, round and floor to YYYY-mm-dd+1 00:00:00. This can break the
            order of an already ordered array.
