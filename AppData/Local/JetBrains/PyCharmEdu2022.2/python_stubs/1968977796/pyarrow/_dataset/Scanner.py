                Create a Scanner from an iterator of batches.
        
                This creates a scanner which can be used only once. It is
                intended to support writing a dataset (which takes a scanner)
                from a source which can be read only once (e.g. a
                RecordBatchReader or generator).
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                source : Iterator
                    The iterator of Batches.
                schema : Schema
                    The schema of the batches.
                columns : list[str] or dict[str, Expression], default None
                    The columns to project. This can be a list of column names to
                    include (order and duplicates will be preserved), or a dictionary
                    with {new_column_name: expression} values for more advanced
                    projections.
        
                    The list of columns or expressions may use the special fields
                    `__batch_index` (the index of the batch within the fragment),
                    `__fragment_index` (the index of the fragment within the dataset),
                    `__last_in_fragment` (whether the batch is last in fragment), and
                    `__filename` (the name of the source file or a description of the
                    source fragment).
        
                    The columns will be passed down to Datasets and corresponding data
                    fragments to avoid loading, copying, and deserializing columns
                    that will not be required further down the compute chain.
                    By default all of the available columns are projected. Raises
                    an exception if any of the referenced column names does not exist
                    in the dataset's Schema.
                filter : Expression, default None
                    Scan will return only the rows matching the filter.
                    If possible the predicate will be pushed down to exploit the
                    partition information or internal metadata found in the data
                    source, e.g. Parquet statistics. Otherwise filters the loaded
                    RecordBatches before yielding them.
                batch_size : int, default 131_072
                    The maximum row count for scanned record batches. If scanned
                    record batches are overflowing memory then this method can be
                    called to reduce their size.
                batch_readahead : int, default 16
                    The number of batches to read ahead in a file. This might not work
                    for all file formats. Increasing this number will increase
                    RAM usage but could also improve IO utilization.
                fragment_readahead : int, default 4
                    The number of files to read ahead. Increasing this number will increase

                fragment_scan_options : FragmentScanOptions, default None
                    Options specific to a particular scan and fragment type, which
                    can change between different scans of the same dataset.
                use_threads : bool, default True
                    If enabled, then maximum parallelism will be used determined by
                    the number of available CPU cores.
                memory_pool : MemoryPool, default None
                    For memory allocations, if required. If not specified, uses the
