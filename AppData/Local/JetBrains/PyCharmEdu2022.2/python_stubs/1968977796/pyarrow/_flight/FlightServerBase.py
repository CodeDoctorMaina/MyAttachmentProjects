    """
    FlightServerBase(location=None, auth_handler=None, tls_certificates=None, verify_client=None, root_certificates=None, middleware=None)
    A Flight service definition.
    
        To start the server, create an instance of this class with an
        appropriate location. The server will be running as soon as the
        instance is created; it is not required to call :meth:`serve`.
    
        Override methods to define your Flight service.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        location : str, tuple or Location optional, default None
            Location to serve on. Either a gRPC URI like `grpc://localhost:port`,
            a tuple of (host, port) pair, or a Location instance.
            If None is passed then the server will be started on localhost with a
            system provided random port.
        auth_handler : ServerAuthHandler optional, default None
            An authentication mechanism to use. May be None.
        tls_certificates : list optional, default None
            A list of (certificate, key) pairs.
        verify_client : boolean optional, default False
            If True, then enable mutual TLS: require the client to present
            a client certificate, and validate the certificate.
        root_certificates : bytes optional, default None
            If enabling mutual TLS, this specifies the PEM-encoded root
            certificate used to validate client certificates.
        middleware : dict optional, default None
            A dictionary of :class:`ServerMiddlewareFactory` instances. The
            string keys can be used to retrieve the middleware instance within
            RPC handlers (see :meth:`ServerCallContext.get_middleware`).
